"""Territory scoring for the end of a game.

This is the one place in the project where a rule of go is written rather than
borrowed: KaTrain derives its final score from KataGo's ownership map and has no
notion of a stone the player has marked dead, so counting a position with a chosen
set of dead stones has to be done here.

Coordinates are display coordinates — (row, col) with row 0 at the top — because
this module only ever talks to the protocol layer.
