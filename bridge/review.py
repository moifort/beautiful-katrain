"""Reading a game record: the tree, the best move, the variation, the progress.

Every function here takes data and returns data. Nothing touches the engine, the
filesystem or the protocol, so the whole module can be exercised against an SGF
written inline in a test and a node whose analysis was filled in by hand.

The bridge never opens a file. The app reads the record and sends its text, which
keeps `shims/chardet` honest and spares the child process any question about the
sandbox.
