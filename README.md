# Moyo

Play Go against KataGo on your Mac.

## Sixteen opponents, not one

Some are calibrated to a rank, from beginner up to dan level. One is trained on
human games and plays the shapes a person would play, mistakes included. Others
are deliberately lopsided: they chase influence, hoard territory, or answer your
move somewhere else entirely.

Change the mode in the middle of a game and your opponent changes character on
its next move.

## See the game turn

A live score graph tracks the lead from your side of the board. You do not have
to ask for an analysis to notice the move where things slipped.

## End the game properly

Two passes and the counting begins. Dead stones are proposed from KataGo's own
reading of the position, then you correct them by clicking. Japanese or Chinese
scoring.

## Read a game record

Open an SGF and walk it with the arrow keys. At any position you can see the move
KataGo would have played, and hold Option with the arrows to unroll the engine's
whole continuation before stepping back into the real game.

## Native, and nothing else

Real menus, keyboard shortcuts, a collapsible sidebar, Liquid Glass. The board
redraws cleanly at any window size.

No account, no network, no telemetry. The engine and its neural networks live
inside the app, so a game never leaves your Mac — and works with no connection at
all.

## Requirements

macOS 26 or later, on Apple Silicon. Nothing else to install: the engine, its
models and everything they need ship inside the app.

## Limits

Records can be read but not written. A review follows the main line and ignores a
record's branches and comments. There is no teaching mode yet.

## License

MIT, same as KaTrain. KataGo ships separately under its own licence.
